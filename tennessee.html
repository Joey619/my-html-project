            <h3>Adventure in Tennessee</h3>
            <p>Joey arrives in Nashville just as the city gears up for its annual country music festival. He’s invited to help a local community rebuild a historic barn, blending old-fashioned know-how with modern tools. As he works, Joey connects with musicians, learning the stories behind classic country songs. One evening, he’s called onstage to share a tale of the open range, his words weaving seamlessly with the twang of a steel guitar. When a sudden storm threatens the festival, Joey rallies volunteers, using his leadership and quick thinking to keep everyone safe. By the end of his Tennessee adventure, Joey has bridged the gap between cowboy and country, showing that courage and community go hand in hand.</p>
