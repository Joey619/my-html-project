            <h3>Fearless Cowgirls</h3>
            <p>Joey teams up with a group of skilled cowgirls to tackle a dangerous mission: rescuing a herd stranded by a flash flood. Working side by side, they combine their strengths—Joey’s experience and the cowgirls’ quick thinking and daring. Together, they navigate treacherous waters, using ropes, horses, and even a drone to locate the lost cattle. The mission is a success, and Joey celebrates with his partners, recognizing the vital role cowgirls play in the modern West. Their shared laughter and mutual respect highlight the power of teamwork and the importance of breaking barriers.</p>
